***Random facts about me***
- Pronouns: she/her
- 🔭 I was a medical claims analyst and medical lab technologist before switching to tech.
- 🌐 My switch was inspired through a project I proposed and enforced to make the claims analysis process easier and training shorter. Technical thinking was considered a vital part of business process management, and thus I decided to pursue the Andela fellowship.
- 🌱 I love to learn. I am always open to feedback.
- ♿️ I’m also learning to live and work with chronic pain after being diagnosed with Fibromyalgia in 2020. I don't know if someone ever gets used to it, but I am resilient and keep the hope alive.
- ⚡ Hobbies: I am a drummer, I love road trips and I love outdoors and nature.


### Thanks for passing by.
